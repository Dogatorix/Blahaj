# Blåhaj Restitched

A Minecraft mod that adds toys and plushies, most notably the IKEA BLÅHAJ!

Continuation of the original Blåhaj mod by [hibiii](https://github.com/hibiii) for Forge!

Most plushies are currently unobtainable with the exception of Blåhaj, Blåvingad, and the Bread Pillow; however, they will be obtainable in the future via a special method.
